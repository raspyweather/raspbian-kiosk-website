# Use Raspbian as Website display
Ever wanted to show your awesome SPA Dashboard on a screen with almost no configuration effort?
This is what you're searching. 
0. Get a clean raspbian iamge
0. use the default user
0. run this script
0. adjust the website url on the desktop
0. if necessary (due to an unresponsive dashboard or a superlarge screen), change the zoom factor (1 = 100%, 0.5 = 50%, 2 = 200%)

## How to run:
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspyweather/raspbian-kiosk-website/master/install.sh | sh install.sh```

## Disclaimer
This is a shitty script which was written once for raspbian requiring the default username ```pi```. Use it for whatever project you want. IDC. I don't maintain this project, it is more a conservation of code; if you want to, feel free to do so.
